# Setting up Node.js

You won't need Node.js until Assignment 5, but it will be useful to install Node.js now and familiarize yourself with it.


## Installation

Go to [https://nodejs.org/en/download](https://nodejs.org/en/download) and download Node.js


## Hello World

Try a quick Hello World example to check that Node.js installed properly.


Content of file `hello-world.js`:
```
console.log("Hello World!");
```


Create a JavaScript file `hello-world.js` as shown above, then run it with Node.js
```
~$ node hello-world.js
Hello World!

~$
```
